If you're a web developer you probably heard about [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). In this post I'll explain what it is and why you should consider using it.

## What is Vite?
Vite is a tool created by Evan You (creator of Vue.js) with a focus on simplifying and speed-up the development. It consists of two parts:
- A development server that provides feature enhancements over native ES modules: lightning fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR), pre-bundling, support for TypeScript, JSX, TSX and dynamic imports.
- A build command that bundles code with Rollup and outputs optimized static assets for production.

<Note>
  **Note**: ES modules are a standard for modularizing JavaScript code. They became available in ES2015 and are supported by all modern browsers. You can read more about them [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules). 
</Note>

## Why Vite?
Before ES modules became available, developers had no way to modularize a JavaScript app in a native way. Tools like Webpack, Rollup or Parcel, helped us with this but problems started to appear when applications became larger and complex. Long waiting times to run a dev server or edit files are common in these cases.

So here is when Vite enters the scene. By making use of native ESM it improves server start time and also HMR time.

**Server start**: Usually when starting a dev server all the files of your application are bundled and served. Vite takes a different approach, it divides the modules in two categories:
- *Dependencies*. Vite pre-bundles these using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) (a Go-written bundler 10-100x times faster than JavaScript-written ones)
- *Source code*. Vite serves it over native ESM, this means that the browser does a part of the job of a classic bundler. This way Vite only needs to transform and serve source code when the browser requests it.

**Updates with HMR**: Vite uses native ESM for HMR as well. This, in contrast to other methods, means that only a limited portion of the dependency chain is invalidated, leading to non-expanding HMR times as the application gains complexity.

## Bundling for production
Vite still bundles your code for production. The reason behind this is that despite the widespread support for native ESM, deploying unbundled ESM in production remains inefficient.

However, Vite does count with a pre-configured build command with multiple optimizations:
- *CSS code splitting*: CSS used by modules in async chunks is extracted and then a separate file is generated for it. This way, the CSS is loaded before the async chunk avoiding FUOC (flash of unstyled content).
- *Preload Directives Generation*: generating `<link rel="modulepreload">` directives for entry chunks and their direct imports improves the loading performance of the app by instructing the browser to load the modules before they are requested.
- *Async Chunk Loading Optimization*: Rollup often generates "common" chunks shared by 2 or more other chunks which, in combination with dynamic imports, form the following scenario: <div className="w-full flex justify-center"><Image src='/images/async_chunk_loading.svg' alt='async chunk loading source:"vitejs.org"' width={685} height={246} style={{width: '90%', height: 'auto'}} /></div> So, in non-optimized scenarios, the browser will request and parse chunk A before knowing that it also needs chunk C: `Entry ---> A ---> C`. But what Vite does in this case is transforming the dynamic imports that split code in a process where, when A is fetched, C is also fetched simultaneously: `Entry ---> (A + C)`

## Simple setup
Getting started with Vite is super straightforward, you only need to install it with:
```bash
npm create vite@latest
```
Then follow the prompts and you'll be ready to go. For more information about the installation process you can check the [official documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).
